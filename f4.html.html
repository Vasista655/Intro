                <p>Snake Game Using Reinforcement Learning</p>
                <h4>Project Description</h4>
                <p>Created a Snake game environment with Python and Pygame. Implemented Reinforcement Learning
                    techniques, specifically Deep Q-Learning, to train an agent to play the game autonomously. Utilized
                    TensorFlow and Keras for neural network development and training. Achieved notable performance
                    enhancement through iterative training cycles, demonstrating effective application of RL in gaming
                    environments.</p>
